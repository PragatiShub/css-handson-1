        <li>CSS stands for Cascading style sheet</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen , paper , or , in  other media</li>
        <li><span class="col"> CSS is not necessary</span><span id="line">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li> <span id="n">External stylesheets are stores in CSS files</span></li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>CSS  can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <div class=words><ul>
        <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal -By using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li> External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li> The most common way to add CSS , is to keep the styles  in external CSS files . However , in this tutorial  we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself</li>

    </ul>
    </div>
    <p> When comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference    is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements .ID  , on the other hand , applies  a style to one unique element . ID is also special in that oyu can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by Javascript.</p>
    <P>In CSS , selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted , a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</P>
    <p> There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly use are class and ID. both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
